This is my first attempt and creating a programming langauge.
Example files are under the test folder.

The goal of this language is to have equal or greater functionality to C#, while trying to enforce a cleaner layout of code. 

Current and planned capabilities and features that differ from C#:
spaces - C# namespace but you can have as many as you want per file
    Spaces will hold using statements.
enforced class structures - all class have a method, constructor, and property area 
interfaces - same as C# interfaces
AUTO keyword - used inside of function declarations will automaticly 
runtime default parameter values - Any varible can be used to default a parameter in the declaration of a function. 
    They will be evaluated on tbd (object instatiation or per function use)
